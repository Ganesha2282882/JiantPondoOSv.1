# JiantPondoOSv.1
OK, so this is a really cringy yet cool project from when I was 10.  It is an "OS" that is a batch file.  It took me forever to do(for a 10 year old), so here it is.  It includes some games and even a web browser.

To install, just clone the repo and run the batch file.  It isn't actually an OS but could look like it if you added it to the startup folder.
